Our Big Kitchen iOS App
======
![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-3.0-orange.svg)

Our Big Kitchen ([OBK](http://www.obk.org.au)) is an amazing non-profit organization, based in Bondi, Sydney, Australia.
Its industrial kitchen is certified (Kosher, Halal, HACCP), and anyone from the community can cook food, either for those
who need it the most, or to start their own food business.

It is maintained by the generous donations from friends, sponsors and companies, but mainly by volunteers who
contribute with their time, skills and energy.

In order to make it very easy for anyone to find when they can help and put their hands up for volunteering, we are donating our time and coding skills to create the OBK App.
